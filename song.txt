I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Woah
